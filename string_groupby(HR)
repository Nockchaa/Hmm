    print((len(list(g)),int(k)),end=" ")
    
    
## groupby is hard to use at first time. still don't know what's going on exactly.
## uses a for loop with 2 variables which are k(unique key) and g(groups)
## if the same alphanumeric occurs, they're grouped in a list
## example given is '1222311' and it's grouped by ['1']['2','2','2']['3','3']['1']
## len(list(g)) provides each list by length
## print the tuple with len(list(g)),int(k) outputs (1, 1), (3, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1) vertically
## added end=" " to prevent the print function automatically seperates the line
